# Portfolio-3: ðŸ§®SQL - Airline Database Analysis and Northwind Database Analysis
# Description
This SQL project explores the Northwind database and Airline database, a classic dataset simulating a small business ERP system. It contains rich information about customers, orders, products, suppliers, employees, and shipping logistics. The goal was to write efficient SQL queries to extract insights that support sales optimization, inventory management, and customer segmentation.

Key objectives:
* Analyze sales performance across regions, products, and time periods
* Identify top customers and high-performing employees
* Track inventory levels and reorder needs
* Understand supplier relationships and shipping efficiency
# Skills 
* **Complex Joins**: Combined multiple tables (Orders, Customers, Products, Employees, etc.) using INNER and LEFT JOINs
* **Window Functions**: Used RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and ROW_NUMBER() to rank sales and employee performance
* **Aggregation & Grouping**: Applied GROUP BY, HAVING, and conditional logic to summarize KPIs like revenue, order volume, and product turnover
* **Subqueries & CTEs**: Built layered logic using Common Table Expressions for modular and readable queries
* **Filtering & Pattern Matching**: Queried customer and product data using LIKE, IN, and date filters
* **Data Cleaning**: Handled nulls, duplicates, and inconsistent entries for reliable outputs
* **Business Insight Generation**: Translated raw data into meaningful metrics like revenue per category, reorder alerts, and customer lifetime value
# Technology 
* **SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)** - Core query language for data analysis
* **Northwind Database & Airline database** -	Sample ERP schema for business simulation
* **SQL IDE (e.g., DBeaver, SSMS, pgAdmin)** - Query execution and result visualization
* **Excel / Power BI** - Exporting results for dashboarding and reporting
# Project Outcome
* Delivered a suite of optimized SQL queries for business-ready insights
* Identified top customers and most profitable product categories
* Ranked employees by sales volume and customer engagement
* Flagged low-stock items and recommended reorder strategies
* Created reusable query templates for monthly reporting and performance tracking
